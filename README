    `pim` is a fork of `rx`.
    It's like vim, for your pixels!

  `rx` was designed with great care and love
    with pixel artists and animators in mind.

  `pim` is being developed to be more ergonomic
    for left hand on the keyboard
    and right hand on the mouse.

OVERVIEW

  `pim` is an extensible, modern and minimalist pixel editor implemented
  in rust[0]. pim is free software, licensed under the GPLv3.

  To build pim from source, see the build sections below.

  Once inside pim, enter the `:help` command to get a list of key bindings
  and commands.

REQUIREMENTS

  At a minimum, OpenGL 3.3 support is required.

BUILD DEPENDENCIES

  * rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
  * cmake (https://cmake.org/download/)

  On macOS, `Xcode` and the `Xcode Command Line Tools` are required.
  The latter can be obtained by running `xcode-select --install`
  CMake can be installed with `brew install cmake`.

BUILD & INSTALLATION

  Before proceeding, make sure the BUILD DEPENDENCIES have been installed.

  Then, clone this repository and from its root, run:

    $ cargo install --locked --path .

  This will install pim under `~/.cargo/bin/pim`.  If you prefer a different
  install location, you can specify it via the `--root <prefix>` flag, where
  <prefix> is for example '/usr/local'.

CONTRIBUTING

  See the CONTRIBUTING file for details. Contributions are appreciated.

TROUBLESHOOTING

  If something isn't working like it's supposed to, there are various things
  you can do to debug the problem:

  * Run `pim` with verbose logging, by using the `-v` command-line flag. This
    will log errors from the underlying libraries that are usually suppressed,
    and will show debug output that might indicate what the problem is.
  * If `pim` is crashing, run it with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` set in your environment
    to show a backtrace on crash.
  * It could be that the issue is related to your configuration - in that case
    the program can be run without loading the initialization script like so:

        pim -u -
